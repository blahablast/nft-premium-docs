# IPFS Uploading

## Using Pinata to access IPFS

We use Pinata here to use `IPFS`. Here is the link: [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/).
This allows you to use someone elses `Blockchain Node`, so you don't have to run your own.
If you do not have an account, sign up for one.
This will require you verify your email before moving forward.
You will want to select the `free tier`, unless you feel like paying.

### Inside the Pinata File Storage

Now that you are here, you will want to click `+ Add`.
Then `Folder Upload`.
Navigate to your `images` folder inside your project and select the whole folder.
Give it a name inside `Pinata`.

##### This site has changed since the video recording and the layout of your files will be a bit different

In the video, their is a column called `CID`.
This column is still there, but it doesn't have that title aand the number in truncated.
You can still `right click` this number and `copy link`, but this gives you the whole link and you will need to remove some stuff.
In your URL, you want to go to `ipfs.io/ipfs/Your NFT CID`.
This is not a huge deal, it is just to verify the NFTs are working as intended.

##### If you want your own artwork to be uploaded, change the hash in the metadata folder for each one
